ATTENTION:
Source code is now being hosted on Bitbucket!
hg.ogitor.org will become read-only in a very short time, so it's not to be used.


IMPORTANT NOTE:
The directories "RunPath/Media" and "RunPath/Projects" are now available as a seperate download. 
To be able to build and run Ogitor, you will need the following files downloaded and extracted into "RunPath" folder:

https://bitbucket.org/jacmoe/ogitor/downloads/media.zip
https://bitbucket.org/jacmoe/ogitor/downloads/projects.zip

Please download those files and extract them to "RunPath" folder in your SOURCE path before building and installing Ogitor.
Do not extract the files into the build directory, even though it might make sense.
The install target will copy the files over.
