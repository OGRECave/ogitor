_This is the repository for Ogitor SceneBuilder, the WYSIWYG scene editing environment for OGRE (www.ogre3d.org)_

**Note: Ogitor now depends on Ogre 1.10!**

**Running OGITOR**

To be able to run Ogitor, you will need the media.zip archive downloaded and extracted into the OGITOR ```"RunPath"``` folder. The projects.zip archive is optional but advised, since it offers a sample scene to get you started. Both archives can be downloaded under the following links:

* [https://bitbucket.org/ogitor/ogitor/downloads/media.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ogitor/ogitor/downloads/media.zip)
* [https://bitbucket.org/ogitor/ogitor/downloads/projects.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ogitor/ogitor/downloads/projects.zip)

**Building OGITOR**

By default, the build script will download and install the media and projects archives, so you don't have to worry about getting them yourself.
You can choose not to by setting OGITOR_DOWNLOAD_SAMPLEMEDIA and OGITOR_DOWNLOAD_SAMPLEPROJECT to FALSE when configuring the project with CMake.
