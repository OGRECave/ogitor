== Compiling: ==
cmake supports 'out of source' builds by default, to use it do this:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

this should create everything into the build/ directory

== Installing libnoise: ==
this is covered by cmake:
  make install 

== how to use libnoise: ==
see examples for details but in general:
 a) you need to supply the library -lnoise to the linker
 b) the includes to the compile with -I /usr/include/noise

== A comment on performance ==
Using compiler optimizations for libnoise is *strongly recommended*.  Using the
unoptimized library is roughly a fifth as fast as using -O3 on my test
computer.

this cmake build by default (if not in developer mode) will build with -O3
